======================

This is a program designed to wipe all the data on a JPeg image or .jpg
***********************************************************************
I found that with the internet being so insecure nowadays it would be
best for people to use cation when posting anything! Pictures are very
incrementing and this can help people take the first step in being safe!
Enjoy!

To use the program you must open a terminal or dos window.

STEPS to use in general
1. In window type "cd "(NO QUOTES) then drag and drop the downloaded folder.
    *This will move you into that directory to execute commands*
    *If you did not get an error message go to step 2*
2. In window type the following depending on Platform.
     *Windows- "sh run.sh"(NO QUOTES)
     *Linux- "sh run.sh"(NO QUOTES)
     *Mac- "./run.sh"(NO QUOTES)
    *If you did not get an error message go to step 3*
3. That should do it! Your pictures have now been wiped clean of all info! Enjoy
